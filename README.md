# Tips ReactJS App & NodeJS API

Tips is an application dedicated to sharing web development tips. Simple visitors can view all the tips. Registered users can like tips and find them easily.

### Need to be fixed :
- [ ] Possibility to like a tip on single view
- [ ] On create tip : change the codeJar highlight language on select new language (for the moment, javascript persist)
- [ ] Token management (when the token expires, automatic reloading or disconnection)
- [ ] Excerpts on tip card doesn't have same lines number

### Nice to have : 
- [ ] Add my account view with managing system (update name, password, email ...)
- [ ] Add a sharing system (Linkedin, Tweeter, facebook)
- [ ] Add a user following system
- [ ] Add the possibility to classify the tips liked
- [ ] Add a pagination system
- [ ] Add an avatar to users
- [ ] Add a render view to see how the code is executed
